This game was a speedrunning puzzler. You the robot would spin through the air at high speed like Sonic to a Perfert Dark covered sound track.
Check out level 4 and 5. I spent alot of time making secret collision mazes in the rocks for other ways to reach the goal -- get to your spaceship as fast as possible.
